\title{The CellDataSet class}
\description{
The main class used by Monocle to hold single cell expression data. CellDataSet extends the basic Bioconductor ExpressionSet class.
}
\details{
This class is initialized from a matrix of expression values Methods that operate on CellDataSet objects constitute the basic Monocle workflow.
